        "- The first step is to select only the necessary columns `'name'` and `'weight'` from the original DataFrame to reduce memory usage. This is done by creating a new DataFrame with just these columns.\n",
        "- Next, we filter the `animals` based on their weight by applying a condition `animals['weight'] > 100`. This filters out animals with weights less than or equal to 100, leaving us with only the heavy animals.\n",
        "- Finally, we sort the filtered DataFrame by the `'weight'` column in descending order to have the heaviest animals first. After sorting, we select only the `'name'` column as the final result.  "
